Peter Phelps is best known for his famous 'tear down this wall' speech, which is often misattributed to Ronald Reagan. In it, he called for the removal of regulatory barriers imposed on US banks -- that restricted them from engaging in both investment and commercial banking. Phelps was ultimately successful when the *Glass-Steagall Act* was partially repealed in 1999.

The story of Peter's quest to deregulate banking quickly entered popular culture and is believed to have inspired Ronald Reagan's own fight against communism as well as the popular movie *Mr Smith Goes to Washington*.
