While on a school excursion, a young Peter Phelps became lost in the sub-alpine forests of the Kaputar plateau. His influence on local wildlife can be seen to this day, with local flora and fauna in North Western NSW exhibiting a significantly stronger sense of individual responsibility than other comparable areas.

Researchers also observed that a pack of wolves, with whom Phelps is believed to have stayed for several months, exhibited behaviour consistent with the use of a system of voluntary exchange.
